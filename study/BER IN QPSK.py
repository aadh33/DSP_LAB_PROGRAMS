Core Concepts:

QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying): A digital modulation scheme where two bits are represented by one symbol with four possible phase shifts.
( E_b/N_0 ): The energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio, a key factor in determining the performance of a digital communication system.

BER (Bit Error Rate): The percentage of bits that have errors relative to the total number of bits sent in a transmission.

Gaussian Noise: A type of statistical noise having a probability density function equal to that of the normal distribution, which is also known as Gaussian distribution.
The code simulates a QPSK communication systemâ€™s performance over a range of ( E_b/N_0 ) values by calculating and plotting its BER.
"""
# Creates an array of ( E_b/N_0 ) values in dB, ranging from 0 to 49.
"""
The range of ( E_b/N_0 ) values in dB is chosen up to 50 to provide a 
wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for the simulation. 
This allows us to observe the performance of the QPSK system under 
various noise conditions, from very poor (low ( E_b/N_0 )) to
 very good (high ( E_b/N_0 )).
 In practice, a range up to 50 dB covers most practical
 communication scenarios, from noisy channels to almost noise-free channels.
 It helps in understanding how the BER decreases as the SNR improves, 
 which is a fundamental characteristic of digital communication systems.
