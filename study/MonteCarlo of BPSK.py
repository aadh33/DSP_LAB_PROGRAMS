#This sets the x-axis range from 0 to 14 dB for Eb/N0. 
#Itâ€™s a common range for plotting BER curves because it typically covers the range of interest where changes in BER are most noticeable
#This sets the y-axis range from (10^{-7}) to (0.1) for BER. The lower limit is set to (10^{-7}) because BER values lower than this are often considered excellent and may not be distinguishable on a log scale. The upper limit is set to (0.1) because BER values higher than this are generally considered poor, and the system would not be functioning effectively.
#These ranges are chosen to provide a clear view of the BER performance over a practical range of signal-to-noise ratios, which is useful for analyzing and optimizing communication systems.
